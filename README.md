# My Reading Journal :) 
*About me*

My name is Jubilee Whaley, and I currently reside in Lakewood,WA. I am originally from the East Coast and moved here to the PNW about 6 years ago and ***absolutely*** love it here! I am esxtremely new to coding, and looking forward to learning new things. I am an Admissions advisor here at Code Fellows, and hope that these classes help me to better assist incoming students to understand the process. 

**What Growth mindset means to me**

Always learning, always figuring out, and always solving problems! Growth mindset to means never taking no for an answer, but progressing to becoming better!

**Reminders to keep myself in Growth Mindset**

- Give myself grace
- Ask questions
- Think of the end goal
